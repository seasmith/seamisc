# Luke's Utility Package

Welcome to my utility package. This is a collection of "random" functions I have created, from the very simple `isFALSE()` to the a-little-bit-more-complexed `expand.grid2()`.

I use these functions all the time. In fact, I round up some of these functions into a single file (`utilities.R`) in my other packages.

My current favorite:

```{r fave, fig.show='hold'}
library(seasmith)

# - Prints plot and returns summary data frame of objects in user workspace.
ls.summary()
```
