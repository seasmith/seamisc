# Luke's Utility Package

Welcome to my utility package. This is a collection of "random" functions I have created

I use these functions at the command-line or store them in a single file (`utilities.R`) within other packages.

My current favorite:

```{r fave1, fig.show='hold'}
library(seasmith)

# - Show the user workspace as a plot and data frame with seasmith::ls.summary().
ls.summary()
```

```{r silent, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
load("~/R/Resume/Dread.RData")

dread <- dread %>%
  mutate(mon_year = factor(mon_year(Date), levels = unique(mon_year(Date)))) %>%
  count(mon_year)
```

```{r fave2}
library(tidyverse)

# Fill-in these implicit missing month-year values...
dread

# ...by using seasmith::seq_fill_date_df()
dread %>%
  seasmith::seq_fill_date_df("mon_year")
```
